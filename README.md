# Code Examples

### This repository contains an assortment of code examples and mini-extracts from larger projects.

### File descriptions:
-------------------------

| **SN** |  **File**   | **Description** |
|----------------|------------|------------|
|1|[Example_of_Database_Driven_Analysis.R](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/Example_of_Database_Driven_Analysis.R)|This file provides an example on how to conduct database_driven analyses and produces [this](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/oncoplot_funccall.pdf) multi-hit oncoplot|
|2|[Breat_cancer_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/Breat_cancer_prediction.ipynb)|Using the [Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) for predictive analysis - improving Aditi's awesome kaggle example. *Using Jupyter Notebook, Python - numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn* |
|3|[Genomic_Subgroups.py](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/Genomic_Subgroups.py)|Application of [Dash-Python](https://dash.plotly.com) in visualizing genomic data. Dash is written on top of powerful libraries and frameworks such as Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js|
|4|[Model_creation_using_ML_algorithm.ipynb](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/Model_creation_using_ML_algorithm.ipynb)|...And this is where the journey began, my first simple test model using a machine learning algorithm|
|5|[Mutation_loads.py](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/Mutation_loads.py)|This file also contains an extract from a larger project on using Dash-Python to create interactive interfaces for visualizing big and complex datasets from back end databases and systems. Please refer to the file for key libraries implemented|
|6|[Mutations_ETL.R](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/Mutations_ETL.R)|Most of the data I have worked with was extracted from variant callers (tools/software used to detect variants from sequencing data) that store their data in vcf or text files. The [structure](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/VCF_Extract.png) of these large files is complex (largely unstructured), data values are not atomic, and the data is not linked to other data components required for integrated data analysis, which hinders effective and efficient data mining processes. This file contains an example of code used to navigate through server files for specific files of interest, reads the data in each called file, structures or transforms the data and finally bulk-loads the clean and structured data into a backend database (an object-relational PostgreSQL database). Each file contains thousands of mutations per line, culminating into millions of records in the database (database constraints like key constraints and referential integrity were further defined between objects). I spent a considerable amount of time optimizing the database to reduce the runtime. It paid off!!. Processes that took hours, like searching and integrating data for downstream analysis, now only took a minute or two! This also provided analyses of orthogonally collected data in ways we hadn't seen before!|
|7|[Mutations_ETL2.py](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/Mutations_ETL2.py)|This file contains another example on data extraction, transformation and loading implemented in Python|
|8|[Pipeline_result_paths.py](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/Pipeline_result_paths.py)|Example 2 on python-based ETL|
|9|[Samples_Object.py](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/Samples_Object.py)|This file contains code that opens a connection to the backend database (also implemented in most files), creates required database objects and loads structured data into the created database object - a more efficient  way of creating database objects and loading data at the same time|
|10|[WGS_QC.py](https://github.com/rasiimwe/Code_Examples/blob/main/WGS_QC.py)|This file contains a Dash example on quality control checks and visualization of sequencing data|
